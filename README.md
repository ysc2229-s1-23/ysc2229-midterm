# Codespaces Guide

Codespaces allows you to program directly in your browser and execute the code on a remote server. This guide will help you get started with Codespaces and ensure you're prepared for the midterm.

## Setting up the Environment

To set up your Python environment in Codespaces:

First, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the necessary packages, such as pytest:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
